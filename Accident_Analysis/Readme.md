# Road Accident analysis
This is a data analysis work done on the Kaggle Dataset of Road Accidents in California.
<br>Based on different features like date, time, city, manner, condition, location, and severity we try to classify whether a given zone results in severe accidents or not.
<br> The data is refined and features(dimension) are reduced using a correlation heatmap.
<br> The following methods are tested: Kernel SVM, Shallow Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
<br> XGBoost outperformed all the other methods on both training and validation sets.
